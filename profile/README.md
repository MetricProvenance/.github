### The Home of the Open Data Governance Standard (ODGS)

**Metric Provenance** is the steward of **ODGS**—the open protocol designed to act as a "Sovereign Brake" for Automated Decision Making (ADM).

We provide the architectural standard to decouple **The Law** (Policy) from **The Machine** (Execution), ensuring that computational models—from Legacy Algorithms to Modern AI—adhere to strict liability definitions.

## 🏛️ The Mission: Ending "The Blindness of Code"

Whether it is a rigid `If/Else` script or a probabilistic LLM, modern compute has a fatal flaw: **It executes logic, but it does not understand Law.**

* **The Problem:** When data definitions drift (e.g., statutory income limits change), the code keeps running the old logic. This causes "Silent Drift" and administrative failure (e.g., *Toeslagenaffaire*).
* **The Solution:** ODGS introduces a **Context Layer**. It cryptographically enforces the legal definition of data *before* the algorithm is allowed to execute.

## 📂 The Standard: ODGS

Our core contribution is the **Open Data Governance Standard (ODGS)**—a vendor-neutral, headless protocol for **Semantic Integrity**.

### 📦 [odgs-protocol](https://github.com/MetricProvenance/odgs-protocol)
*The Reference Implementation for "Git-as-Backend" Liability Logging.*

**Technical Capabilities:**
-   **Universal Interceptor:** Works with Python, Java, COBOL, and LLM Agents.
-   **Sovereign Sidecar:** Writes forensic audit logs (EU AI Act Art. 12) directly to *your* private Git. **No data leaves your perimeter.**
-   **Hard Stop Mechanism:** Physically prevents inference if the data definition does not match the active Law.

## 🇪🇺 Regulatory Alignment

This project is developed in alignment with the **Dutch Standardization Institute (NEN)** and **ISO/IEC**.

* **EU AI Act:** Article 10 (Data Governance) & Article 12 (Record Keeping).
* **Administrative Law:** Supports the "Careful Preparation Principle" (Awb 3:2).
* **Digital Sovereignty:** Ensures Dutch government data logic remains portable and vendor-independent.
